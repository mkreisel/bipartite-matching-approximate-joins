# Approximate Joins Using Bipartite Matching

This repository contains demo code related to the article [One Way to Join Data Sets With No Common ID Number](https://garoux.medium.com/one-way-to-join-data-sets-with-no-common-id-number-da85af6f0e40). The article explains a useful technique for joining two data sets which do not have a common identifier, but where you can define a distance between rows in each data set. Common use cases include matching data sets based on geolocation (lat/long) or address (approximate string matching). The code shows an example implementation using randomly generated latitude and longitude values.
